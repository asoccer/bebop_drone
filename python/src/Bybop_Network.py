    """
    Simple implementation of the ARNetwork protocol.

    This implementation does not support intenal fifos. If multiple threads tries to send data on the
    same buffer at the same time, the actual send order is undefined.

    The 'send_data' call is blocking to allow simpler implementation, but is not doing busy waiting so
    it can be called from a thread without locking the GIL in python implementations that use one.

    This implementation use a listener to warn the application of newly received data. The listener
    should implement a 'data_received' function accepting the following arguments:
    - buf : The buffer on which this data was retrieved
    - recv_data : The actual data, as a packed string (use the struct module to unpack)
    And a 'did_disconnect' function, without arguments, which will be called if the product
    does not send any data on the network (probably because we lost the network link, or
    because the product has run out of battery)
