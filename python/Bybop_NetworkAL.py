    Alternate implementation of the ARNetworkAL protocol, for Wifi devices.

    This implementations is fully compliant with the protocol, and has no major
    limiations.

    This implementation uses a thread to do background reads from the socket, and
    send data to the application through a listener. This listener must implement a
    'data_received' function, which will receive the following arguments:
    - type : The type of data received (ack, data, low latency, data with ack)
    - buf : The buffer on which this data was retrieved
    - seq : The sequence number of the data
    - recv_data : The actual data, as a packed string (use the struct module to unpack)
    And a 'did_disconnect' function, without arguments, which will be called if the product
    does not send any data on the network (probably because we lost the network link, or
    because the product has run out of battery)
